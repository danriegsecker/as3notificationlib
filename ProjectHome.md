This project makes it easy to add cross-platform notifications to your AIR application. It handles "native system notifications" like the dock icon bouncing and the taskbar icon flashing, and it allows you to easily create alert "pop-ups".

There is currently no zip archive available.  Please check the code out using subversion.
